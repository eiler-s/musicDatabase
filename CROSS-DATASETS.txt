1st Query: Find how many artists from the musicbrainz dataset are bands in the discogs dataset.
This query will combine the 'name' field of the Band dataset and the 'name' field of the Artists dataset from discogs modeled 
with the 'artist_name' field from the Artist dataset from musicbrainz modeled. The result will be a single number of how many 
bands are represented across both datasets. This is interesting because the musicbrainz database does not distinguish between
bands and individual artists, and this could lead to categorizing many musicbrainz artists as either bands or individuals. 

2nd Query: Connect Artist_URL and LabelURL from discogs to URL from musicbrainz.
One problem with the musicbrainz dataset is that it didn't connect artist names to the URLs it provided for those artists and labels.
Since discogs does, we will compare the URLs to see if we can add any new information about artists to the musicbrainz URL dataset.
URLs are represented as strings, so it should be straightforward to compare them. The result should be a junction table with
artist information about any matching URLs from the datasets.

3rd Query: Compare labels across musicbrainz and discogs.
We will connect the labels from the musicbrainz dataset with those in the discogs dataset. This is useful because then musicbrainz label information can be connected to their associated URLs found in the previous query.
