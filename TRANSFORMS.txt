Please note that we just switched our primary dataset from US Census data to music data from MusicBrainz earlier this week.

We have modeled our staging tables in the ERD diagram. This diagram also represents our modeled tables as well because our staging tables did not require any transformations. That is to say that our staging tables already contained distinct entities and did not present any referential integrity violations nor contain duplicate records. Each table has a valid primary key, which we have identified in the ERD.

There should be a PK-FK relationship between the Release_Group and Release tables. Release_Group.id should be a primary key refering to the foreign key Release.release_group. However, we had to omit some rows of each of our tables when ingesting the data due to problems with double quoted values interfering with the parsing of the CSV tab delimiter. As a result, some entries are missing from the primary key and some “foreign keys” are referring to nonexistent primary keys. 

We have some attributes that were incorrectly type casted as Strings by the bigquery autoload when the data tables were ingested. The dataset uses the string “\N” to indicate null values, which has caused many fields that are supposed to be integers or timestamps to be marked as String values by the big query autodetected schema. We have not type casted these attributes to their correct data types because of the existence of the “\N” values in the columns. As a result, we will wait to replace “\N” values with actual nulls once we get to the data-cleaning stage of the project where we use tools such as Beam. Once the “\N” values have been successfully removed we will be able to type cast the attributes to their correct types.
