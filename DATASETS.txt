Our primary dataset consists of multiple combined files from the 2015 American Communities Survey which is run by the US Census Bureau./
According to the ACS website, the ACS is "the premier source for detailed population and housing information about our nation"./
This dataset contains lots of different information about the population of various communities throughout the entire United States./
Due to the size of the dataset and the amount of information it contained, we chose to narrow down the data. We decided to focus on the/
southern United States, specifically Texas, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Arkansas, Tennessee, North/
Carolina, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia. We also picked four categories of information to analyze in each of these/ states: Education, Language, Race and Age&Sex. The data was available in CSV files from data.world, and we combined the files for each/ state by category to create a dataset that met the size requirements for the project.//

The ACS data provides multiple levels of analysis for each category. For example, in the Sex&Age category, it provides Sex by Age for/
total population of each state, sex by age for men, sex by age for men under 5, sex by age for men 5 to 9... etc. The columns are named/
with codes that can be retrieved from the metadata that goes along with the CSVs on data.world. For example, in the Sex&Age file, column/
header B01001_001 refers to "Sex by Age for Total Population". The entries in the cells are generally the number of people in that/
state in that category. Each data file has many columns. We are only showing 10 columns here as an example./
