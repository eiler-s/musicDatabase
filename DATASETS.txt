Our primary dataset consists of multiple combined files from the 2015 American Communities Survey which is run by the US Census Bureau./
According to the ACS website, the ACS is "the premier source for detailed population and housing information about our nation"./
This dataset contains lots of different information about the population of various communities throughout the entire United States./
Due to the size of the dataset and the amount of information it contained, we chose to narrow down the data. We decided to focus on the/
southern United States, specifically Texas, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Arkansas, Tennessee, North/
Carolina, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia. We also picked four categories of information to analyze in each of these/
states: Education, Language, Race and Age&Sex. The data was dowloaded in CSV files from data.world where each state had a seperate CSV/
for each of the Census Bureau's categories. In order to meet the size requirements for the project we then combined all the states' data/
into a single CSV for each category. As a result, we have five CSV files in our dataset, one for each category./


The ACS data provides multiple levels of analysis for each category. For example, in the Sex&Age category, it provides Sex by Age for/
total population of each state, sex by age for men, sex by age for men under 5, sex by age for men 5 to 9... etc. The columns are named/
with codes that can be retrieved from the metadata that goes along with the CSVs on data.world. For example, in the Sex&Age file, column/
header B01001_001 refers to "Sex by Age for Total Population". The entries in the cells are generally the population of people in that/
state in that category./


These files are of interest to us because of the depth of information conducted by the Census Bureau. While each CSV contains a separate/
category of data, they can all be related together in order to be cross examined. For instance, the Language file, which contains rows/
of estimated populations proficienty in language, splits the population into degrees of proficiency across many columns. These columns/
contain farther designations, indicating the subpopulations of those proficient in English by race. These columns could be compared to the/
Race datafile to determine what percentage of the local racial population is proficient in English. Likewise, in the Language file there is/
a column detailing the educational attainment of citizens older than 25 who are proficient in English, which could be compared with the/
Education file, which provides more data about the educational attainment within the population./


Although we have selected this dataset as our primary dataset due to its immense detail and interrelations between the files, we have not yet/
selected a secondary dataset. Fortunately, the generality of our primary dataset would make it well suited for correlation with data from a/
wide variety of fields including economics, epidemology, immigration, or even popular media./


Each datafile in our dataset has many columns. We are only showing 10 columns in our sample data as an example./
