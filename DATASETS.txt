Our primary dataset is the MusicBrainz database dataset. MusicBrainz is an open-source project that allows users to use the organization's /
software to upload information about different music entities such as records released, the works performed in releases, associated /
record labels, language and area of artist origin, etc. This information is compiled in the MusicBrainz database and website, where /
users can rate music entities by percieved likeability and suggest edits to the information existing in the database./

We downloaded raw data dumps from the MusicBrainz project without schema specifications. Although there is an ERD on MusicBrainz's website, /
it is not current with the database's state, we have had to manually identify column names and types using provided contextual information /
about the entities. We then uploaded the datadumps with manual schemas to the Google Cloud Platform. The datatables meet our project /
requirements of the existence of columns containing valid potential primary keys, as well as the existence of relationships /
between the individual tables. At least 5 tables meet the size requirements for our project. For instance, a music artist is described as /
coming from a certain area can be related to the recordings they produced, which in turn have attributes describing the area the records were /
made. Finally, these area keys can also be used to find recording locations, record labels, and live music events that take place in the /
same area. Date information exist in many tables to describe what time period a particular music entity was active or created./


There are 19 tables in this dataset. The dataset can be downloaded using FTP and the instructions given at the following link: /
